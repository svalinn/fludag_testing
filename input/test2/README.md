Test 2
=====================
Neutron irradiation on material geometry, parallel plane beam of neutrons irradiate and assembly of 
10 volumes composed alternately of Iron and vacuum.

Track length flux estimate in every volume, every volume has the volume used to normalise
the particle score to 1.0, we expect good agreement for the total flux.

Quantities Tested
=====================
* Neutron Irradiation
* Low energy irradiation
* Transport in Iron and Vacuum
* USRTRACK scoring

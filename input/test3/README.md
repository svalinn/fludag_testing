Test 3
=====================
Neutron irradiation on material geometry, parallel plane beam of neutrons 
irradiate and assembly of 10 volumes composed alternately of Water and vacuum.

Track length flux estimate in every volume, every volume has the volume 
used to normalise the particle score to 1.0, we expect good agreement for 
the total flux.

Quantities Tested
=====================
* Neutron Irradiation
* Low energy irradiation
* Transport in Water and Vacuum
* USRTRACK scoring
